This repository is a study implementation of Hexagonal Architecture (aka Ports and Adapters).

The Hexagonal Architecture, also referred to as Ports and Adapters, is an architectural pattern that allows input by users or external systems to arrive into the Application at a Port via an Adapter, and allows output to be sent out from the Application through a Port to an Adapter. This creates an abstraction layer that protects the core of an application and isolates it from external — and somehow irrelevant — tools and technologies.
